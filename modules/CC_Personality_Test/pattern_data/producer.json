    "The Motivation Pattern's motivation arises largely from his interior and from very deep personal goals. This prior commitment to your own goals prevents you from automatically accepting the group's goals. The Performer needs to combine his personal goals with the goals of the organization. Because the Filmmaker has always exercised control over the most important aspects of his life, he often develops a strong sense of responsibility.",
    "The Director shows a deep interest in his work and a continuous and intense desire to achieve what he intends. He has a high opinion of his work and usually does things for himself to make sure everything is done right. Values ​​hard work and under pressure ”prefers to do” than delegate to someone else. When you delegate something, you usually do it again if it doesn't meet your expectations. His premise says: ”If I succeed, the credit goes to me, but if I fail, I take responsibility.”",
    "If the Director communicates more with others, he would stop thinking about ”this or that” about ”I have to do it myself” or ”I want all the credit for myself”. You may need help to consider other proposals and get the results you want. The Performer knows that he is working to the best of his ability and expects similar recognition for his contribution, in certain organizations through high profits and in others with positions of command."
