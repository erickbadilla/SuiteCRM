    "The developer has an extensive network of contacts that provides him with an active base to carry out his business. Gregarious and sociable, it is easy for him to make friends. Rarely is he intentionally opposed to someone. The promoter seeks socially favorable environments where he can continue to develop and preserve his contacts. With his excellent ability to speak, he promotes his own ideas very well and generates enthusiasm for other people's projects. Thanks to its extensive sphere of contacts, the Promoter has access to the right people when he needs help.",
    "Since the promoter by nature prefers interaction with others and participates in activities that involve contact with people, he is less interested in carrying out the work. Even if your work imposes solitary activities, you will continue to look for situations that involve meetings and active social life. He likes to participate in meetings, committees, and conferences.",
    "Because of his natural optimism, the Promoter tends to overestimate the ability of others. He usually reaches favorable conclusions without having considered all the facts. With proper training and direction, the Promoter can be helped to develop objectivity and to give due importance to the results. Planning and controlling time can be challenging. It is in your best interest to limit the time spent talking and thus remind yourself of the urgency to “finish” and complete a task."
