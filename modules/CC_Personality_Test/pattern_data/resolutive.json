    "The Resolute is usually a strongly individualistic person who continually seeks new horizons. Because he is extremely self-sufficient and independent of thought and action, he prefers to find his own solutions. Relatively free from the restrictive influence of the group, the Resolution is able to evade conventions and usually provide innovative solutions.",
    "Although quite often tends to be direct and energetic, the Resolute is also astute at manipulating people and situations. However, when the Resolution is required to cooperate with others in situations that limit their individuality, the Resolution can become belligerent. He is extremely persistent in achieving the results he wants, and he does everything in his power to overcome the obstacles that come his way. Also, your expectations of others are high and can be very critical when your standards are not met.",
    "The Resolute is very interested in achieving his own goals, as well as having opportunities for progress and challenges. Because his efforts are so focused on the end result, he often lacks empathy and appears indifferent to people. You could say something like: “take an aspirin, I'm the same” or “don't be a child, it will pass.”"
