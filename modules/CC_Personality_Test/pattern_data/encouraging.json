    "People with encouraging patterns know exactly the results they want, but they don't always verbalize them right away. They show what results they want only after an appropriate environment has been created and the other person is willing to accept them. For example, these people offer friendship to those who want to be accepted, more authority to those who seek power, and security to those who seek a predictable environment.",
    "The encourager could be charming in his dealings with others. He is persuasive to get help when you are presented with repetitive and time consuming details. However, people often experience a sense of conflict before them, feeling on the one hand attracted, and curiously at the same time distanced. Others may feel \"used.\" Although the encouraging person sometimes inspires fear in others and rejects their decisions, the encouraging person is usually appreciated by his collaborators. This is achieved by using his enormous ability to persuade whenever possible. The Encourager prefers to achieve his goals not by dominating people but by acting as an agent to do the job."
