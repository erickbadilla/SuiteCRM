    "The Perfectionist is methodical and precise in his way of thinking and working, so he usually follows ordered procedures both in his personal and work life. He is extremely conscientious and takes great care in detailed and precise work. The Perfectionist wants stable conditions and activities that are easy to predict, making him comfortable in a clearly defined work environment. You want clarity about what is expected of you at work, how much time is available, and how your work will be evaluated.",
    "The perfectionist can get bogged down in the details when he has to make decisions. He knows how to make important decisions, but can be criticized for the time it takes to gather and analyze information before deciding. Although he likes to know the opinion of his superiors, the Perfectionist is able to take risks when he has data that he can interpret and use to draw his own conclusions.",
    "The Perfectionist evaluates and evaluates others under precise rules that ensure concrete results and adheres to normal operating procedures. This conscientious attention to standards and quality is valuable to the organization, however, the Perfectionist tends to define his value more by what he does than by what he is as a person. Therefore, he often reacts to personal compliments with the idea that: “What does this person want?“ If you take a sincere compliment for who you are, it could boost your self-confidence."
