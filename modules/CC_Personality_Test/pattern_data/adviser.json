    "The Counselor has the particular gift of solving the problems of others. Impress with your affection, empathy and understanding. It is easy for the Counselor to find what is good in people and assumes an optimistic attitude. The counselor prefers to deal with people on the basis of an intimate relationship. Knowing how to listen, especially to problems, he is discreet in his suggestions and does not try to impose his ideas on others.",
    "The Counselor is usually extremely tolerant and patient with people who don't perform well on the job. Under pressure, it is difficult for him to confront performance problems directly. It is often too indirect to order, demand or discipline others. With his \"people are important\" attitude, the Counselor often places less importance on performance. Sometimes it requires help setting and meeting realistic deadlines.",
    "Often the Counselor takes the criticism as a personal affront, but responds positively if he receives attention and compliments for a job well done. When you hold a position of responsibility, you often pay attention to the quality of working conditions and provide appropriate recognition to your team members."
