    "Critical thinking skills are often highly developed in the Goal. Stresses the importance of drawing conclusions and basing actions on facts. He looks for precision and accuracy in everything he does. However, to efficiently carry out its work, the Goal often combines intuitive information with the data it has. When he doubts the course to take, he avoids making a fool of himself by preparing meticulously. For example, the Target will perfect a new skill in private before using it in a group activity.",
    "The Goal prefers to work with people who, like him, prefer to maintain a calm work environment. As he can be reluctant to express his feelings, there are those who consider him shy. You are particularly uncomfortable with aggressive people. Despite this tempered appearance, the Target has a strong need to control the environment. It usually exercises this control indirectly by requesting adherence to rules and regulations.",
    "The Goal is concerned with arriving at “correct” answers and it may be difficult for him to make decisions in ambiguous situations. Your tendency to worry can lead to \"analysis paralysis.\" Too often, when you make a mistake, you are hesitant to acknowledge it and are looking for information to support your position."
